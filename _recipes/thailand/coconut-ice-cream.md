  <strong>Makes:</strong> ~1 litre<br>
  <strong>Prep:</strong> 10 minutes<br>
  <strong>Churn:</strong> ~20 minutes (+4–6 hours to firm)<br>
</div>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>400 ml <strong>sweetened cream of coconut</strong> (e.g., Coco López)</li>
<li>240 ml whole milk, well chilled</li>
<li>360 ml thickened/heavy cream, well chilled</li>
<li>60 g sweetened coconut flakes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Base:</strong> In a jug blender, blend the sweetened cream of coconut and milk until completely smooth and homogenous.</li>
<li><strong>Finish:</strong> Stir in the cold heavy cream. Cover and chill 1–2 hours if your mixture isn’t very cold.</li>
<li><strong>Churn:</strong> Churn in an ice‑cream maker until soft‑serve texture (about 20 minutes). Sprinkle in the coconut flakes during the last 2–3 minutes of churning.</li>
<li><strong>Freeze:</strong> Transfer to a lidded container, press baking paper onto the surface, and freeze 4–6 hours until scoopable.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use <em>sweetened cream of coconut</em> (a pourable cocktail ingredient), not unsweetened coconut milk or coconut cream.</li>
<li>For extra coconutty depth, toast some of the flakes and fold them through at the end.</li>
<li>Optional: a teaspoon of vodka or white rum helps keep the texture scoopable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul><li>Freeze 5–7 days. Soften on the counter 5–10 minutes before scooping.</li></ul>

<h4>Serving</h4>
<ul><li>Top with toasted coconut, pineapple or serve alongside mango sticky rice.</li></ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Thin matchsticks of ginger lightly salted then soaked in ume plum vinegar (<em>umezu</em>). The vinegar gives Beni Shoga its vivid red colour and bright, salty-sour flavour — no artificial colouring needed.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>For the Ginger</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100 g fresh young ginger (or regular ginger)</li>
<li>½ tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the Pickling Liquid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100 ml ume plum vinegar (<em>umezu</em>)</li>
<li>Optional: a few red shiso leaves for extra colour and aroma</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Peel the ginger and slice into thin matchsticks. Sprinkle with the salt, mix well and leave 30 minutes to draw out moisture.</li>
<li>Rinse briefly under cold water and pat dry with paper towel.</li>
<li>Pack the ginger into a clean, sterilised glass jar. Pour over the ume vinegar to fully submerge (add red shiso, if using). Seal and refrigerate.</li>
<li>Pickle at least 3 days (5 gives best balance) before using.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colour & flavour:</strong> Ume vinegar naturally colours the ginger and adds tangy, salty complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Ginger type:</strong> Young ginger is tender and mild; regular ginger works too and is spicier.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep refrigerated. Will keep up to 1 month as long as the ginger stays fully submerged.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Serving Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Serve as a garnish with okonomiyaki, yakisoba, gyudon, or katsu curry.</li>
<li>Add a few strips to rich or fried dishes for a sharp, refreshing contrast.</li>
</ul>

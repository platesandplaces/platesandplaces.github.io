<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A beautifully rustic, caramelised cheesecake that’s creamy inside and charred on the outside. This crustless Basque classic gets its signature look from a very hot oven and tall parchment lining.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>Butter, softened, for greasing the tin</li>
<li>1 kg cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
<li>7 whole eggs</li>
<li>400 g caster sugar</li>
<li>500 ml thickened cream</li>
<li>1 tbsp plain flour (omit for gluten-free)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 220°C (430°F). Lightly grease a 23 cm springform tin with softened butter. Line base and sides with baking paper, letting it rise 2–3 cm above the rim.</li>
<li>Using a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth.</li>
<li>Add the eggs one at a time, fully incorporating each before adding the next.</li>
<li>Add sugar and beat until dissolved. Reduce speed to low, add the cream and mix until combined.</li>
<li>Add flour and mix until the batter is smooth and silky.</li>
<li>Pour into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 minutes, until puffed and deeply golden brown. The centre should still jiggle.</li>
<li>Cool completely in the tin, then chill 4–5 hours (or overnight). Rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Texture is custard-like in the centre with a burnt, caramelised top.</li>
<li>Omit flour for a gluten-free version; texture will be slightly creamier.</li>
<li>Resting before serving softens texture for optimal enjoyment.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refrigerate in an airtight container up to 4 days. Do not freeze (texture will suffer).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Serving Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Serve slightly cool or at room temperature.</li>
</ul>

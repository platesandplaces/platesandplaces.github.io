<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A fragrant, savoury-sour Filipino soup featuring pork ribs and belly simmered with tomatoes, onion and vegetables, finished with fresh tamarind. Balanced, hearty and perfect with steamed rice.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>For the soup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>60 ml vegetable oil</li>
<li>500 g pork ribs</li>
<li>500 g skinless boneless pork belly, cut into 4 cm pieces</li>
<li>1 large onion, cut into wedges</li>
<li>3 vine-ripened tomatoes, cut into wedges</li>
<li>1 small red capsicum, seeded and cut into wedges</li>
<li>1.5 litres water</li>
<li>4 cm piece horseradish, peeled and cut into thirds</li>
<li>1 Japanese eggplant, sliced on the diagonal (3 cm)</li>
<li>200 g snake beans or green beans, trimmed (tie into knots if desired)</li>
<li>2 tsp salt flakes</li>
<li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the souring agent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100 g tamarind pulp</li>
<li>250 ml boiling water</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To serve</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thinly sliced spring onions</li>
<li>Steamed rice</li>
<li>Fish sauce</li>
<li>Kalamansi or lemon wedges</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brown the pork:</strong> Heat 2 tsp oil in a large deep pot over medium–high. Sear ribs 4 minutes, turning to brown all sides; set aside. Add 2 tsp oil and sear pork belly 4 minutes; set aside with ribs.</li>
<li><strong>Sweat aromatics:</strong> Add remaining oil, reduce to medium, then add onion. Cook 2 minutes, scraping browned bits. Add tomatoes and capsicum; cook 4 minutes until softened.</li>
<li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Return ribs and belly to the pot. Add 1.5 L water and bring to a boil. Reduce to low–medium and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare tamarind water:</strong> Meanwhile, soak tamarind pulp in 250 ml boiling water for 15 minutes. Mash to combine, then strain through a sieve, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids.</li>
<li><strong>Sour & cook veg:</strong> Stir strained tamarind liquid into the soup; simmer 5 minutes. Add horseradish and eggplant; cook 5 minutes until eggplant is almost tender. Add beans and cook 3 minutes, or until vegetables and pork are tender.</li>
<li><strong>Season:</strong> Add salt and black pepper to taste. Adjust with fish sauce or more tamarind for extra savouriness/sourness.</li>
<li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle into a large bowl, scatter with spring onions and serve hot with steamed rice, fish sauce and kalamansi/lemon wedges.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pork cuts:</strong> Pork shoulder/neck can sub for belly and ribs; bone-in pieces add flavour.</li>
<li><strong>Tamarind:</strong> If pulp isn’t available, use 2–3 tbsp tamarind concentrate, to taste.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Radish, water spinach (kangkong) and okra are traditional options; add with other veg by cook time.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage &amp; Reheating</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refrigerate up to 3 days in an airtight container. Reheat gently over low heat; add a splash of water if needed.</li>
<li>Tamarind water can be made a day ahead and chilled.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Serving Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Serve freshly made with steamed rice; the broth deepens in flavour by the next day.</li>
</ul>

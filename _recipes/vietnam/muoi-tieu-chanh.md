<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A quick, highly authentic Vietnamese condiment. Mix fine salt and freshly ground black pepper, then brighten with lemon or (preferably) lime at the table. Lovely with grilled meats, seafood, fried spring rolls and simple steamed dishes.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Salt & Pepper Mix</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>¼ tsp fine salt (to taste)</li>
<li>¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>Optional: a pinch of MSG; a small pinch of sugar</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To Serve</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 wedge fresh lemon or lime (lime is most traditional)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Combine salt, pepper and any optional MSG or sugar in a small dipping bowl. Serve with the citrus wedge. Just before eating, squeeze in juice and stir with chopsticks or a spoon until fully combined. Adjust with more citrus or seasoning to taste.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lime gives the freshest flavour; lemon works if lime is unavailable.</li>
<li>MSG and/or a pinch of sugar add roundness — both are common in home cooking.</li>
<li>Adjust water or sugar levels in other dishes depending on your fish sauce’s saltiness when pairing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Best made fresh. If preparing ahead, keep the dry mix separate and add citrus at the table.</li>
</ul>

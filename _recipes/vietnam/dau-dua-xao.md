<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A fast, aromatic vegetable side. Briefly steaming the beans before stir-frying keeps them bright and crisp, while the simple sauce adds savoury depth without heaviness.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Main</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>400 g yardlong beans, cut into 5 cm pieces</li>
<li>1 tsp salt (for washing)</li>
<li>60 g red capsicum/bell pepper, sliced lengthways (optional, for colour)</li>
<li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 tbsp cooking oil (for beans) + 2 tbsp (for stir-frying)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stir-Fry Sauce</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
<li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
<li>½ tbsp sugar</li>
<li>⅓ tsp ground black pepper</li>
<li>⅓ tsp MSG (optional)</li>
<li>2 tbsp water</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Dissolve the salt in a large bowl of water. Add the beans, swish to clean, then rinse twice in fresh water. Drain well and toss with 1 tbsp oil to coat lightly.</p>
<p>Steam the beans over boiling water for 2 minutes to set colour and retain crunch. Remove and set aside.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, mix fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, black pepper, MSG (if using) and water until the sugar dissolves.</p>
<p>Heat a wok or large pan over medium heat. Add 2 tbsp oil, then the shallots and garlic; stir-fry about 1 minute until fragrant and just golden.</p>
<p>Add the steamed beans and optional capsicum. Stir-fry on high heat for 1–2 minutes to combine with the aromatics.</p>
<p>Pour in the sauce and toss for about 1 minute, reducing slightly so it coats the beans.</p>
<p>Turn off the heat, finish with a little extra black pepper if desired, and serve hot with jasmine rice.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yardlong beans may be labelled Chinese long beans or snake beans.</li>
<li>Green beans can substitute; reduce steaming time slightly as they cook faster.</li>
<li>To keep colour and texture, avoid over-steaming and over-stir-frying.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage &amp; Reheating</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refrigerate up to 2 days in an airtight container.</li>
<li>Reheat quickly in a hot pan to preserve texture; avoid microwaving too long.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Serving Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Serve with steamed jasmine rice and grilled pork chops, or as part of a shared Vietnamese family-style meal.</li>
</ul>

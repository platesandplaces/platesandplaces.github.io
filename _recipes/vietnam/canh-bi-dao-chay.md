<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A light, clear soup made with winter melon, often served in southern Vietnamese homes to balance richer dishes. Mild, cooling and naturally sweet, it’s a simple everyday staple that complements savoury meals.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>For the Broth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>400 g winter melon, peeled and cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
<li>600 ml water or light vegetable broth</li>
<li>1 small shallot, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Seasoning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>½ tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
<li>¼ tsp white pepper (optional)</li>
<li>½ tsp sugar (optional, rounds out flavour)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Garnish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chopped coriander</li>
<li>Chopped spring onion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Peel the winter melon, remove seeds and spongy centre, and cut into bite-sized chunks. In a medium pot over medium heat, warm a little oil and sauté the shallot and garlic until fragrant but not browned. Pour in the water or vegetable broth and bring to a boil, skimming any foam. Add the winter melon and reduce to a gentle simmer; cook 10–12 minutes until translucent and tender. Season with salt, white pepper and a pinch of sugar if using; taste and adjust. Turn off the heat and garnish with coriander and spring onion. Serve hot alongside rice or other dishes.</p>

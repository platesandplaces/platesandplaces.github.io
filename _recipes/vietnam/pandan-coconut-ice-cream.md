  <strong>Makes:</strong> ~1 litre<br>
  <strong>Prep:</strong> 20 minutes<br>
  <strong>Churn:</strong> 20–25 minutes (+4–6 hours to firm)<br>
</div>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>360 ml full‑fat coconut milk</li>
<li>360 ml heavy cream</li>
<li>100 g sugar</li>
<li>4 egg yolks (≈80 g)</li>
<li>5 ml pandan extract <em>or</em> 45 ml fresh pandan juice*</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Heat:</strong> In a saucepan, warm coconut milk, cream and sugar over medium heat until steaming.</li>
<li><strong>Custard:</strong> Whisk yolks in a bowl. Slowly temper with the hot dairy, whisking constantly. Return to the pan and cook on low, stirring with a spatula, until it lightly coats the back of the spoon (≈78–82°C / nappe), 6–8 minutes. Do not boil.</li>
<li><strong>Flavour & chill:</strong> Remove from heat; stir in pandan extract (or strained fresh juice) and a pinch of salt. Strain through a fine sieve. Chill completely (ice bath + 4–6 hours in the fridge).</li>
<li><strong>Churn & freeze:</strong> Churn 20–25 minutes to soft‑serve, then transfer to a lidded container, press baking paper onto the surface and freeze 4–6 hours.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>*Fresh pandan juice:</li>
<ul><li>Blend pandan leaves with a little water; strain. The flavour is grassy and subtle compared with extract.</li></ul>
<li>Optional: fold through a handful of toasted coconut at the end for texture.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul><li>Freeze 5–7 days. Soften 5–10 minutes before scooping.</li></ul>

<h4>Serving</h4>
<ul><li>Lovely with sticky rice, jackfruit or tropical fruit.</li></ul>

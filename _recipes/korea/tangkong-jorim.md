<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This variation skips the syrupy glaze and instead highlights the natural nuttiness of the peanuts. Dry-fried with a touch of oil, then tossed with a light salt–sugar mix for a crisp texture — great with drinks or as a simple banchan.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 cup raw peanuts (with skin)</li>
<li>1 tbsp neutral oil (vegetable or canola)</li>
<li>1 tsp sugar (white or demerara)</li>
<li>½ tsp salt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Heat a dry frying pan over medium heat; add the oil and peanuts. Stir continuously to coat and fry evenly.</li>
<li>Cook 8–10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the peanuts begin to pop and crackle and look glossy.</li>
<li>Transfer to a strainer to drain excess oil. While still warm, sprinkle with sugar and salt; toss to coat.</li>
<li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sugar swap:</strong> Demerara works well in place of traditional coarse Korean brown sugar.</li>
<li><strong>Serving use:</strong> A casual snack with drinks or as part of a Korean snack/banchan spread.</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> Add a pinch of garlic powder or a splash of soy near the end for a savoury twist.</li>
</ul>

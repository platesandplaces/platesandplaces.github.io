<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A simple Korean technique to clean and toast sesame seeds for deeper nuttiness. Great over rice, noodles, banchan and grilled meats.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>½ cup raw sesame seeds (white or black)</li>
<li>Water, for washing</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wash:</strong> Put sesame seeds in a bowl and cover with water. Swirl gently; skim off any floating seeds or debris. Rinse and drain well.</li>
<li><strong>Toast:</strong> Transfer wet seeds to a dry pan over medium–low heat. Stir constantly until dry and lightly golden, listening for soft popping and a nutty aroma (3–5 minutes).</li>
<li><strong>Cool & store:</strong> Remove from heat, spread to cool, then store in a clean, dry jar.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Toasting develops aroma and removes residual moisture — especially helpful for farm-fresh seeds.</li>
<li>Keep away from humidity; moisture dulls the crunch.</li>
<li>Optional: grind lightly in a mortar just before serving for extra fragrance.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Store airtight up to 1 month at cool room temperature. No reheating needed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Serving Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Finish Korean dishes like <em>namul</em>, stews, and rice bowls; sprinkle over noodles and grilled meats.</li>
</ul>

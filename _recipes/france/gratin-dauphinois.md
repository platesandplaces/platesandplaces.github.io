<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A creamy, subtly garlicky potato bake from Dauphiné. Traditionally there’s no cheese: just potatoes, milk, cream, and nutmeg — silky inside, bronzed on top.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 kg waxy potatoes (e.g., Dutch creams), peeled and thinly sliced (2–3 mm)</li>
<li>400 ml milk</li>
<li>300 ml double cream (thickened cream)</li>
<li>1 small garlic clove, halved</li>
<li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
<li>¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg (or to taste)</li>
<li>1 tsp fine salt (plus a pinch to season the dish)</li>
<li>Butter, for greasing the dish</li>
<li>Optional garnish: chopped parsley or dill</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Heat oven:</strong> 200°C (390°F). Rub a medium baking dish (about 1.5–2 L) with the cut side of the garlic, then grease with butter.</li>
<li><strong>Simmer potatoes:</strong> In a wide pot, combine milk, cream, mustard, salt and nutmeg. Add sliced potatoes. Bring just to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally so slices don’t catch. Simmer 5–7 minutes until just starting to soften.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Tip potatoes and all the creamy liquid into the prepared dish, spread evenly and smooth the top.</li>
<li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake 40–45 minutes until bubbling and deep golden, and a knife slides through easily.</li>
<li><strong>Rest:</strong> Stand 10 minutes before serving (layers set and cut more cleanly). Garnish with herbs if using.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potatoes:</strong> Waxy varieties hold their shape; avoid very starchy potatoes here.</li>
<li><strong>Do not rinse slices:</strong> Natural starch helps thicken the sauce.</li>
<li><strong>No cheese?</strong> Classic dauphinois has no cheese; adding Gruyère turns it into a different (still delicious) gratin.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat in a 160°C oven (covered, then uncover to re-crisp) or microwave.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Serving Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Serve with roast meats or a crisp green salad. Great make-ahead side for gatherings.</li>
</ul>

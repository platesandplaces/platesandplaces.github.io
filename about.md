About Plates & Places

Food has a way of bringing places to life. Whether it’s the comfort of a home-cooked meal, the thrill of trying something new, or the quiet joy of wandering through a local market — for me, it’s always been about more than just what’s on the plate. This site is a space to share my journey with recipes, travel stories, and food finds from near and far — a collection of experiences, flavours, and memories gathered along the way.

I grew up on the Central Coast of New South Wales, where my food world was fairly limited — mostly classic Western dishes and the usual Chinese restaurants. I still remember one restaurant near the family home, which, at the time of writing, is still standing, though it’s seen better days. There was another Chinese restaurant at Erina Fair, now long gone. Looking back, neither place was anything remarkable, but they were the best options I knew when the craving for something different struck. I can still recall the hurried service, the clatter of plates and bowls, and the yelling from the kitchen — all part of the experience.

Vietnamese food wasn’t something I encountered back then. A place opened briefly in Terrigal, and while it caused a bit of a stir at first, I only visited once. The flavours didn’t quite land with me at the time. A Japaese restaurnt chain arrived for a while too, offering something different — and it’s where I finally learned to use chopsticks, thanks to their clever training set.

Everything changed when I moved to Sydney in my early 20s. Working in the CBD, I found myself surrounded by friends from all over the world, each one introducing me to different cuisines and hidden gems across the city. I tried Korean cold noodles for the first time, tasted proper Vietnamese pho, and slowly built my chilli tolerance with dishes that tested my limits. My friends knew the best spots, the right dishes to order, and the flavours to look out for — guiding me into a world of food I never knew existed.

As time went on, I wanted to recreate these experiences at home. Maybe it was always there, this love for cooking — rooted in my memories of visiting my grandparents. My grandfather was often at the stove, while my grandmother baked pecan pies, churned homemade vanilla chocolate chip ice cream, and prepared roasts that filled the house with comforting aromas. I still have her old ice cream machine, over 40 years old now and still going strong — they really don’t make them like that anymore. I remember sneaking down to the basement, exploring the deep freeze and six-door commercial fridge, always on the hunt for something sweet.

One dish I always remember, though I’ve never quite recreated, is my grandfather’s vegetable barley soup. Even after all these years, I haven’t found a version that tastes quite like his. Those early dinners, shared after school with freshly cooked vegetables and homemade sauces, remain some of my most cherished food memories.

In more recent years, I’ve been lucky enough to travel to a handful of places that left a lasting impression — Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, France, and London. These were holidays, not extended stays, but each visit deepened my curiosity and love for food in some way.

During winter in France, I found myself searching for the perfect hot chocolate — rich and thick, so unlike the versions back home. Whether in Paris, Lyon, Aix-en-Provence, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, or Reims, each place offered its own take on familiar dishes. Even something as simple as steak frites seemed impossible to replicate at home. Wandering through markets, even in winter, I was struck by the fresh produce and homemade foods — reminders that food is at the heart of life here.

It reminded me of Japan in some ways — the attention to detail, the celebration of seasonality, and the pride in even the simplest things. Whether it’s a beautifully layered pastry in France or a carefully packed bento box in Japan, both cultures have taught me to appreciate food as an experience.

Sometimes, it’s these dishes that bring back memories long after the trip has ended — a choux pastry or grilled duck breast takes me back to Paris, steak with foie gras reminds me of lunch inside the Palace of Versailles, and boat noodles in Bangkok or binagoongan in the Philippines spark their own special recollections.

Closer to home, food connects me with the people around me. My partner, from Vietnam, and my close friends also from Vietnma, Thailand and Singapore have shared their ways of cooking, their flavours, and their traditions with me. Trying to recreate childhood favourites for my partner — always chasing the memory of how his mother made them — has become one of my biggest cooking challenges (and joys). Sometimes, it’s the small details — the wrong soy sauce, the missing herb — but that’s where the fun lies. The dish might always taste good, but striving to make it better keeps me going.

The recipes I share here are from my home kitchen — a blend of traditional dishes, modern takes, and things I’ve adapted over time. I try to cook with honest ingredients, avoiding overly processed foods when I can. That doesn’t mean there isn’t store-bought stock in the cupboard for busy days, but I like to keep things as natural and home-cooked as possible.

Alongside recipes, I’ll also be sharing stories — from my travels abroad and local experiences — wherever there’s something memorable to tell. Sometimes that might be about a restaurant or café I’ve visited, but not just as a review. I want to share why that place stood out, what made it worth remembering — whether it’s the food, the people, or just the experience of being there.

I’ve thought about starting this blog for years. Maybe I hesitated because I wondered if it would be too hard to set up, or if I’d even have enough to say. Social media never felt quite right — too fast, too demanding. This space feels different. There’s no pressure to post regularly, no algorithm to satisfy. Just a place where I can share when I’m ready, when there’s a recipe, a story, or a memory worth telling.

I hope that anyone who stumbles across this blog — whether you’re scrolling on the train, looking for a recipe, or just curious about food and travel — finds something here that sparks inspiration. Maybe it gives you an idea to try in your own kitchen, or just a moment of enjoyment as you read.

Thanks for stopping by.
